# DynaPsPscPyPy3-Ba
A comprihensive drop-in dynamic batch launcher for, Ps1 and Py, scripts...
If I could use this for all of my batches, it would make things simple, however, this would require each program to have the same size, and I would loose any utility functions in the current batch launchers, maybe that could be moved to the setup-install.bat files...hmm...either way, the primary concept is for test scripts, so I can have all the test scripts in one folder, and one batch to run them ALLL!! That way I can relevantly name a test script, and throw it in the folder, then without doing anything else, run the batch to launch it, I mean oh right I could use right click to run a powershell script with my pwsh installed, except I cant, because I re-assigned it to edit with notepad+
