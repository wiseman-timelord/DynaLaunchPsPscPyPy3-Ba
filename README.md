# DynaLaunchPsPscPyPy3-Ba
A comprihensive drop-in dynamic batch launcher for, Ps1 and Py, scripts...
If I could use this for all of my batches, it would make things simple, however, this would require each program to have the same size, and I would loose any utility functions in the current batch launchers, maybe that could be moved to the setup-install.bat files...hmm.
