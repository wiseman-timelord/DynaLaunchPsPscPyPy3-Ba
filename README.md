# DynaPsPscPyPy3-Ba
A comprihensive drop-in dynamic batch launcher for, Ps1 and Py, scripts...

If I could use this for all of my batches, it would make things simple, however, this would require each program to have the same size, and I would loose any utility functions in the current batch launchers, maybe that could be moved to the setup-install.bat files, but, that is for installing the libraries...either way, the primary concept is for test scripts, so I can have all the test scripts in one folder, and one batch to run them ALLL!! That way I can relevantly name a test script, and throw it in the folder, then without doing anything else, run the batch to launch it, I mean oh right I could use right click to run a powershell script with my pwsh installed, except I cant, because I re-assigned it to edit with notepad++.
HEnce, this is intended for test scripts.
The script will assume that if the user has pwsh installed, then they will want to use that, otherwise powershell, likewise, if the user has python3 installed it will use that comand instead of python, its a bit of an assumption, that will remove testing for compatibility, but, what the hell people, who the what, tell em to install the new one or I cant take them seriously as an end user....
